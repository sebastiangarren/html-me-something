        <ul>
        <li><h2>Voice-powered Forums</h2></li>

            <p>Imagine if there was a system which allowed many people to hold multiple 
                conversations at once and properly threaded the conversations for easy 
                playback?</p>
        
        <li><h2>School Alarm System</h2></li>

                <p>School bell alarm systems are thousands of dollars, but Android phones from 
                    Walmart are 20 bucks. What if there was an app which allowed users to program
                    their own complex bell system into a network of phones quickly?</p>
        
        <li><h2>Alexa Music Just Played/Will Play</h2></li>

                <p>If you are like me you love exploring new music. You also prefer to
                    know the song title and artist so that you can remember what you like.
                    Wouldn't it be nice if Amaxon Alexa told you what three songs she just played
                    after every set, and then told you what song is coming up next? I think so.</p>
     
        <li><h2>Launchcode Website Improvement</h2></li>
        
                <p>I love Launchcode. But the learning website could use some improvements. Throughout
                    Unit 1 there is no progress bar for how far along you are in the lesson
                    and to get to the table of contents to check, one has to open to a whole 
                    new webpage. I should create a progress bar.</p>
                
                <p>Unit 2 is a whole new beast, and does a great job at reinforcing the Git concepts 
                    repeatedly. Throughout the Unit there is a lot of navigating to external sites
                    and there is no telling how big or small the link to the unknown will be.
                    Wouldn't be nice if there was a word count or concept count to give the student
                    a better idea of how big the task on the other side of the link is?</p>
        </ul>
